This Java-based Banking System Application is a console-driven program that simulates core banking operations. It allows users to add and manage customers, accounts, beneficiaries, and transactions through an interactive menu. The application supports retrieving account and transaction details for specific customers, viewing beneficiaries, and performing basic banking actions like deposits and withdrawals. Designed using an object-oriented approach, it separates concerns through entity classes and a service interface. Though currently using in-memory data storage, the structure makes it easy to integrate with a database for persistence. This application serves as a foundational model for understanding basic banking workflows and implementing them in Java.
